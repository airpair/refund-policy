Synopsis
> Only two scenarios qualify customers for refunds. If you are short on time, 
we think a minute to read [sec 2.1](#2-1-guarantee-terms) and [sec 3.2](#3-2-delivering-on-scheduled) is adequette to understand when customers are entitled to refunds. For full context and the nitty gritty, you
can read this policy in full. It coveres responsibilities of
customers and experts impacting refunds as well as explicitly flagging some
(but not all) scenarios that do not qualify.

## 1. AirPair is a Markeplace

### 1.1 Marketplace vs Consulting Services

***AIRPAIR*** <sup>**AIRPAIR** is defined as the services provided through the domain [airpair.com](https://www.airpair.com/)</sup> provides a platform for connecting and facilitating ***CUSTOMER(s)*** <sup>**CUSTOMER** is defined as user *who has paid to* to get software help via AIRPAIR and not had their payment(s) refunded or reversed.</sup> and ***EXPERT(s)*** <sup>**EXPERT** is defined as a user presented on AIRPAIR as a supplier of paid software consulting services</sup> to ***EXCHANGE*** <sup>**EXCHANGE** is defined as a `booking` by a CUSTOMER with payment into AirPair escrow intended for released to the EXPERT upon delivery of software consulting services.</sup> high-end software related consulting services.

By partipating in an EXCHANGE, you accept this Refund Policy and acknowledge:
1. This Refund Policy is designed in the context that AIRPAIR is a marketplace - and NOT a supplier of Software Consulting Services. 
2. CUSTOMERS are solely responsible for incorporating information, recomendataions and code provided by EXPERTS into their own products.
3. AIRPAIR and EXPERTS are fully indemnified against damages or loss of revenue caused or experience by CUSTOMERS.

### 1.2 Your responsibilities 

Healthy `consumer <-> marketplace <-> supplier` interactions are 
more complex than traditional `consumer <-> supplier` ecommerce.

To continue meeting CUSTOMER expectations for fast turnaround and efficient 
EXCHANGE with high-quality available EXPERTS, CUSTOMERS and EXPERTS have duties 
towards one another to assist in completing EXCHANGES in reasonable timeframes. 
Failure to fulfil responsibilities outlined in sec 3 and sec 4 in a reliable or 
timely manner impact entitlement to and extent of refunds.

## 2. AirPair Money Back Guarantee

To save **CUSTOMERS** time researching EXPERTS and availability
(required on most other platforms), AIRPAIR was designed for 
CUSTOMERS to trust the marketplace in its representation of EXPERTS
as suitable quality and relevant for a given EXCHANGE. 

AIRPAIR provides curated recommendations, ratings and links of social profiles
to help CUSTOMERS evalute and choose whom to book. CUSTOMERS are, however, 
ultimately responsible for deciding EXPERTs matches their expectations and
confirm so implicitly when they continue working past their first hour with any new EXPERT.

CUSTOMERS are entitled to NO QUESTIONS ASKED MONEY BACK WITHIN 5 BUSINESS DAYS
within the constraints outlined in [sec 2.1](#2-1-guarantee-terms).

### 2.1 Guarantee Terms
> - - - 
**In cases when **CUSTOMER** expectations are NOT met, **AIRPAIR** will fully 
refund **(or credit)** the total purchase amount, if **CUSTOMER** has **<sub>(1)</sub>** NOT RELEASED ESCROW and **<sub>(2)</sub>** NOT WORKED PAST THEIR FIRST HOUR with an **EXPERT** and <sub>(3)</sub> within 7 days CLAIMED
VIA EMAIL to team@airpair.com their **EXPERT** was unfit for the presented requirements.**
- - -

## 3. Expert responsibilities

### 3.1 Confirming delivery time

AIRPAIR allows CUSTOMERS to book EXPERTS before the parties agree on
delivery time (most commonly the time of a pairing session). When booked, 
payment is immediately secured in escrow and EXPERTS are expected to proactively 
negotiate and confirm a delivery time as quickly as possible. If the expert 
has not confirmed or suggested alternate time options after 12 hours from being
booked the customer may swap to another EXPERT.

### 3.2 Delivering on schedule

> - - -
**In the event an **EXPERT** is (and not the **CUSTOMER** in any way) at fault for failing to completing all scheduled consulting time, **CUSTOMERS** have the right to a full refund (or credit) of all funds associated with the 
**EXCHANGE** that have not been released from escrow.**
- - -

#### 3.2.1 Live Pairing & Offline Scenarios

Most commonly, delivering scheduled time means punctually attending and being
present for the entire length of a live pairing session.

In the case of offline work, the confirmed booking time represents
the agreement of when the work will be complete and handed over.

#### 3.2.2 Partial delivery

If CUSTOMER and EXPERT originally worked for 10 hours, that were released from from escrow, then the CUSTOMER books the EXPERT for 5 additional hours, but the EXPERT only completes 2 by the delivery time, the CUSTOMER is entitled to a refund (or credit) for the full amount paid for 5 hours.

## 4. Customer responsibilities

### 4.1 Confirming delivery time

AIRPAIR allows CUSTOMERS to book EXPERTS before the parties agree on
delivery time (most commonly the time of a pairing session). 

CUSTOMER must **engage EXPERTS via chat** as soon as possible to 
lock in delivery. Refunds are not available if a CUSTOMER has not replied to 
an EXPERT via chat within 24 hours of a booking - even if a delivery time is
never established.

### 4.2 Honoring Bookings

Once a CUSTOMER books an EXPERT, they are required to complete the EXCHANGE 
within 8 weeks.

Refunds are NOT entitled when:
1. CUSTOMERS change their mind
2. Requirements change or become no longer relevant
3. CUSTOMER is at fault for delaying full completion of EXCHANGE within 8 weeks

### 4.3 Inhibiting delivery

If a CUSTOMER inhibits an EXPERT from being able to deliver service,
the EXPERT is entitled to full payment and refunds are not available.

In the case of live pairing, if a CUSTOMER's setup or bandwidth inhibits 
communications, or they are more than 15 minutes late, the EXPERT is entitled to consider the EXCHANGE complete.
